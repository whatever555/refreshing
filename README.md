# Refresccer
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ndlkimdchjgnpchcpfbpninkkfhgkefc  
Use refrecsser to automatically refresh your css files while you style your page
# How to use
Refresccer needs to be enabled for each specific domain on which you want to use it. 
Be warned that it will increase chrome's cpu usage (especially on older machines) and should only be used when writing css. 
If you find the extension to be problematic you can decrease the refresh rate or increase the buffer size.
# Support
If your screen is flashing you can try decrease the refresh rate and/or increase the buffer (memory) for that domain.
To edit these options just click on the extension icon
